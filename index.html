    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Zimbabwe, and I’m currently in my final year at Galgotias University, India, pursuing a Master's in Computer Application with a specialization in Computer Network and Cyber Security (2023–2025).</p>
    <p>My passion for cybersecurity is intense — the word itself makes me hungry to learn. I’ve just completed my Ethical Hacking training with Craw Security and am preparing for the EC-Council certification.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve been curious about technology to such an extent that Computer Science was my best subject. During my secondary school and my High school in my batch they would definitely know that none will take the prize of being the best student other than me. This passion has been growing day by day till now as im about to be a Certified Ethical Hacker. Its my career choice but now i see it as my hobby too</p>

  <h3>Galgotias University, India</h3>
  <p>Pursuing my MCA with a specialization in Computer Networks and Cyber Security has been a transformative journey. Despite being in a new country and initially not knowing Hindi, I received tremendous support from both faculty and fellow students. The lecturers have been exceptionally knowledgeable and approachable, always ready to clarify doubts and encourage deeper learning.</p>

  <p>Academically, I have maintained a consistent CGPA of 8.35, 8.58, and 8.54 over the last three semesters, which reflects my dedication and the quality of education I’ve received. The diverse learning environment pushed me to step out of my comfort zone, adapt quickly, and grow both technically and personally.</p>

  <p>One of the highlights of my academic work includes co-authoring a research paper titled <strong>“A Survey of Comparative Analysis of Online Product Reviews”</strong>, which has been accepted and is pending publication. This project sharpened my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making in digital environments.</p>

  <p>Overall, the MCA program has not only strengthened my technical foundation but also empowered me to confidently pursue a career in cybersecurity and research.</p>

  <h3>Craw Security, Delhi</h3>
  <p>I recently completed my Ethical Hacking training with Craw Security from March to April 2025. During this training, I was introduced to a wide range of tools used by white-hat hackers and cybersecurity professionals.</p>

  <p>The hands-on approach significantly improved my practical skills, especially in using Kali Linux for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and ethical hacking practices. The trainer was exceptionally supportive, always encouraging me to dig deeper into real-world scenarios and tools.</p>

  <p>This training boosted my confidence in tackling cybersecurity challenges and laid a solid foundation for my upcoming EC-Council certification exam.</p>

<section id="cisco" class="details-section hidden">
  <h3>Cisco Junior Cybersecurity Career Path</h3>
  <p>I completed the Junior Cybersecurity Career Path from Cisco between 2024 and 2025. This comprehensive program included multiple foundational certifications such as <strong>Introduction to Cybersecurity</strong>, <strong>Networking Basics</strong>, <strong>Networking Devices and Initial Configuration</strong>, <strong>Endpoint Security</strong>, <strong>Network Defense</strong>, and <strong>Cyberthreat Management</strong>.</p>

  <p>The course provided in-depth theoretical and practical knowledge of core cybersecurity principles. I particularly enjoyed working with Cisco Packet Tracer, where I solved real-world network configuration and security challenges. This experience enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of secure network design.</p>

  <h3>Maharshi Dayanand University – BCA</h3>
  <p>I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Application (BCA) at Maharshi Dayanand University, which laid the foundation for my career in technology. During this program, I was introduced to the fundamentals of computer science and gained a strong understanding of programming, databases, and software development.</p>

  <p>This degree played a crucial role in building my interest in cybersecurity and set the stage for my advanced studies and certifications in the field.</p>
