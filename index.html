    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Zimbabwe, and I’m currently in my final year at Galgotias University, India, pursuing a Master's in Computer Application with a specialization in Computer Network and Cyber Security (2023–2025).</p>
    <p>My passion for cybersecurity is intense — the word itself makes me hungry to learn. I’ve just completed my Ethical Hacking training with Craw Security and am preparing for the EC-Council certification.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve been curious about technology to such an extent that Computer Science was my best subject. During my secondary school and my High school in my batch they would definitely know that none will take the prize of being the best student other than me. This passion has been growing day by day till now as im about to be a Certified Ethical Hacker. Its my career choice but now i see it as my hobby too</p>

  <h3>Galgotias University, India</h3>
  <p>Pursuing my MCA with a specialization in Computer Networks and Cyber Security has been a transformative journey. Despite being in a new country and initially not knowing Hindi, I received tremendous support from both faculty and fellow students. The lecturers have been exceptionally knowledgeable and approachable, always ready to clarify doubts and encourage deeper learning.</p>

  <p>Academically, I have maintained a consistent CGPA of 8.35, 8.58, and 8.54 over the last three semesters, which reflects my dedication and the quality of education I’ve received. The diverse learning environment pushed me to step out of my comfort zone, adapt quickly, and grow both technically and personally.</p>

  <p>One of the highlights of my academic work includes co-authoring a research paper titled <strong>“A Survey of Comparative Analysis of Online Product Reviews”</strong>, which has been accepted and is pending publication. This project sharpened my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making in digital environments.</p>

  <p>Overall, the MCA program has not only strengthened my technical foundation but also empowered me to confidently pursue a career in cybersecurity and research.</p>
