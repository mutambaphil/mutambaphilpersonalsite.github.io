    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Zimbabwe, and I’m currently in my final year at Galgotias University, India, pursuing a Master's in Computer Application with a specialization in Computer Network and Cyber Security (2023–2025).</p>
    <p>My passion for cybersecurity is intense — the word itself makes me hungry to learn. I’ve just completed my Ethical Hacking training with Craw Security and am preparing for the EC-Council certification.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve been curious about technology. The picture below is from my Prize Giving Day at Hartzel High School in 2015 when I was awarded Best Student in Computer Science.</p>
